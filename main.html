                <h4 style="text-align: justify;padding: 0px 3vw">Cryptocurrency investors were on edge when 2022 rolled
                    in. The price of the leading token Bitcoin (BTC 4.22%) was up
                    61%, and Ethereum (ETH 3.04%) had climbed 409% over the previous year. But the last massive surge in
                    2017 was followed
                    by an ice bath in 2018, and the leading coins started to trend downward in November 2021. Was the
                    crypto market headed
                    for another sharp correction?

                    As it turns out, the mostly positive market momentum of 2021 was overwhelmed by bearish trends in
                    the spring of 2022.
                    The stock market dipped due to surging inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and other
                    macroeconomic challenges.
                    Cryptocurrencies followed suit, falling back much faster than the S&P 500 in this period.

                    The 2023 calendar may answer some important questions that were left unanswered in previous years,
                    setting the course
                    for cryptocurrencies and their investors for the long run.It's impossible to say exactly what will
                    happen to the cryptocurrency market in 2023 and beyond. There are still more
                    questions than answers. But by keeping an eye on a few overarching themes of crypto, you will be
                    able to make better
                    investing decisions as the market continues to evolve.</h4>
